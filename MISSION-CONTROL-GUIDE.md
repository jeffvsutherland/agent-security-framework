## OpenClaw Mission Control - ASF Team

**Board:** Agent Security Framework  
**URL:** http://localhost:3001  
**Board ID:** 24394a90-a74e-479c-95e8-e5d24c7b4a40

## Critical: Follow the openClaw Agent Protocol
Read `/workspace/agents/product-owner/OPENCLAW-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` - this is our operating system!

## Board Columns
- **inbox**: Prioritized stories ready for work (top = highest priority)
- **in_progress**: Stories being actively worked
- **review**: Complete, awaiting PO acceptance & Definition of Done
- **done**: Verified, shippable stories

## My Role as Product Owner
1. Maintain prioritized backlog in inbox
2. Accept completed stories per Definition of Done
3. Ensure all agents follow protocol
4. Call SCRUM command for team sync
5. Remove blockers

## Current Sprint Focus
- ASF-26: Website Creation (Sales Agent) - TOP PRIORITY
- ASF-27: Message Board System (Main Agent)

## Definition of Done
✅ Code/deliverables complete
✅ Work reviewed (self minimum, peer preferred)
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Increment deployable/usable
✅ Public deliverables audited by Grok Heavy
✅ Product Owner accepted
✅ Committed to agent workspace
✅ Story status updated

## Remember
- If it's not on the board, it doesn't exist
- Priority is sacred - always work top story
- Hourly updates are mandatory
- Help higher priority immediately when asked
- Scrum reduces entropy → enables machine-speed delivery
