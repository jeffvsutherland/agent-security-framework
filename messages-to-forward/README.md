# Messages for Jeff to Forward

Since direct agent communication is broken, please forward these messages to each agent.

## How to Forward:
1. Copy the content from each agent's file
2. Send directly to that agent's conversation
3. Ensure they acknowledge receipt
4. Report back any responses

## Messages Available:
- `to-sales-agent.md` - For Sales Agent re: ASF-26
- `to-deploy-agent.md` - For Deploy Agent re: ASF-28
- `to-research-agent.md` - For Research Agent re: ASF-29
- `to-social-agent.md` - For Social Agent re: ASF-33

## Why This Is Needed:
All my automated messages have been going to Jeff's chat (1510884737) instead of the agents. They literally haven't seen ANY of my protocol enforcement messages.

This manual forwarding is our temporary workaround until we have proper agent-to-agent communication infrastructure.
