## 🎬 Running the Demo

Anyone can now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeffvsutherland/asf-security-scanner.git
cd asf-security-scanner/demo
./run-demo.sh
```

This shows the complete workflow:
1. **Detecting** oracle and openai-image-gen vulnerabilities
2. **Fixing** with secure credential management
3. **Verifying** the vulnerabilities are resolved

## 📊 Demo Impact

The demo clearly demonstrates:
- These are **real vulnerabilities** (same as Moltbook breach)
- ASF provides **working solutions** not just warnings
- The fix is **practical and implementable**

## 🎯 Key Achievement

We've moved from concept to fully documented, runnable demo on GitHub showing:
- The exact vulnerability that exposed 1.5M tokens
- How to fix it with encrypted credential storage
- Verification that the fix works

This is professional-grade documentation that enterprises can evaluate!
