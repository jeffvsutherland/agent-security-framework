# ASF Sprint Quick Actions - February 20, 8:13 AM ET

## 🚨 Immediate Jira Updates Needed

### 1. Move ASF-26 to "In Progress"
```
In Jira:
- Open ASF-26 (Website Creation)
- Click "Start Progress" or move to "In Progress" column
- Assign to: ASF Sales Agent
```

### 2. Update Sprint Scope
Since we only have 30% done with 2 days left, pick ONE option:

**Option A - Reduce Scope (Recommended)**
Move these to next sprint:
- ASF-5 (YARA rules)
- ASF-6 (Community testing)  
- ASF-18 (Code review process)
- ASF-22 (Spam monitoring)
- ASF-24 (Spam reporting)

Keep only critical stories:
- ASF-26 (Website) - HIGH PRIORITY
- ASF-27 (Message Board) - HIGH PRIORITY  
- ASF-23 (Mission Control) - IN PROGRESS
- ASF-2 (Docker) - IN PROGRESS
- ASF-4 (Deployment guide) - NEEDED

**Option B - Extend Sprint**
- Change end date from Feb 22 to Feb 25
- Add note about mission control complexity

### 3. Quick Status Summary for Jira

```
