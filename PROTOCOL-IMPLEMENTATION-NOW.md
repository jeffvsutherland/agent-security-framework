### 3. Set Hourly Timer
Every 60 minutes, update your story:
```
**What I did:**
- [Specific accomplishments]

**What I'll do next:**
- [Next 1-2 tasks]

**Blockers:**
- [Any impediments or None]
```

### 4. Current Priority Order
Based on Jira board:
1. ASF-23 (Mission Control) - Jeff working
2. ASF-26 (Website) - Sales Agent should be updating
3. ASF-28 (Security Policies) - Available

### 5. External Audit Gate
For any public-facing security work:
