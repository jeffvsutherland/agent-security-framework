✅ Built authenticity verification systems
✅ Created fake agent detection algorithms

We're offering FREE pilot programs to help platforms:
- Identify and remove fake agent accounts

We have the receipts - documented evidence, working detection tools, and a comprehensive framework for agent authenticity.

- The real scope of the authenticity problem
- What legitimate agents are building while fakes grab headlines
