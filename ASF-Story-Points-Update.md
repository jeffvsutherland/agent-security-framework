## Notes for Sprint Planning

1. **Conservative Estimation**: Given Sprint 1 issues, keeping Sprint 2 at 26 points
2. **Buffer Time**: Each agent should have 20% buffer for unexpected work
3. **Dependencies**: ASF-22 depends on ASF-21 completion
4. **Risk Items**: ASF-28 (SSO) and ASF-32 (Mobile) are high complexity
5. **Quick Wins**: ASF-21, ASF-29 can be completed quickly for momentum

**Recommendation**: For Sprint 3, consider 28-32 points based on Sprint 2 performance. Priority should be Performance & Scale epic to handle customer growth.
