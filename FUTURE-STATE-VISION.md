## 💡 Key Insight

Today's failures weren't agent failures - they were infrastructure failures. Sales Agent proved that with proper tools and communication, agents WILL work effectively.

The solution being built addresses every pain point discovered:
- No communication → Message Board
- No tool access → Individual accounts
- No monitoring → Mission Control
- No accountability → Full audit trail

## 🦅 Product Owner Perspective

This is the transformation from:
- Chaos → Order
- Waste → Value
- Frustration → Flow
- Potential → Reality

We're not just fixing bugs. We're building the future of autonomous agent teams.
