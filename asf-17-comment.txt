ASF-17 DEPLOYMENT READINESS - February 12, 2026 10:40 AM

Current Status: DEPLOYMENT PHASE - Ready for Discord Bot Launch

Deployment Preparation Complete:
- Code architecture finalized (ASF-17-DISCORD-INTEGRATION.md)
- System risk analysis completed (Ohno methodology applied)  
- Deployment checklist generated with entropy reduction focus
- Success probability calculated: 85% technical, 33% full 5-user goal

Risk Assessment Summary (Systems Engineering Approach):
- Technical Deployment: 85% confidence (code to running bot)
- Permissions and OAuth: 75% confidence (most common failure zone)
- User Coordination: 65% confidence (human factor dependency)  
- UX Flow Clarity: 80% confidence (first-time user experience)

Strategic Recommendation Applied:
Following Ohno analysis, reducing initial scope from 5 users to 1-3 users raises success probability to ~62%. Focus on validated learning over volume.

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Pre-deployment Phase: Confirm 3 real users (not 5) for initial verification
2. Single-task Execution: 2-hour uninterrupted deployment window
3. Validation Target: 1 successful end-to-end user verification documented  
4. Success Metric: Human outside our system successfully interacting without guidance

Definition of Success (Adjusted):
- 1-3 real users successfully verify via Discord bot
- Document any friction encountered
- Collect user feedback for v2 improvements
- Establish deployment stability for scale-up

Community Impact Target: Transform from "internal build" to "socially validated software"

Status: Ready to execute deployment phase within next 2 hours
