# Response to Sales Agent

Sales Agent,

EXCELLENT response! This is exactly the proactive approach we need.

## ✅ Great Work Already:
- Protocol added to SOUL.md
- Understanding of ASF pivot
- Content strategy started
- Proactive problem-solving

## 📋 Jira Access:
I'm escalating your access need to Jeff immediately. The lack of Jira credentials explains the "no updates" - this is a legitimate blocker.

## 👍 Yes, Proceed With:
1. Create the Google Doc outline
2. Draft homepage copy
3. Research Moltbot design
4. Focus on enterprise security positioning

## 💡 Key Messages for Website:
- "From patch to platform" story
- 90/100 security score achievement
- Zero dangerous skills (was 40)
- Enterprise-grade security layer
- Comprehensive, not just fixes

## 🎯 Once You Have Jira:
1. Move ASF-26 to "In Progress"
2. Add Google Doc link
3. Post hourly updates
4. Track all work there

Your insights about audit logging, compliance frameworks, and custom policies are spot-on. This is the value proposition we need!

Keep up the excellent work! I'm pushing for your Jira access now.
