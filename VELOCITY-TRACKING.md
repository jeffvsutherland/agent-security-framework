## Velocity Killers Identified

1. **Communication Failure** - Agents not receiving work
2. **Tool Access** - No Jira credentials
3. **Infrastructure** - No agent monitoring
4. **Accountability** - No automated tracking

## Velocity Multipliers Needed

1. **Reliable Messaging** - Agent-to-agent communication
2. **Automated Assignment** - Top story auto-pulls
3. **Progress Visibility** - Real-time dashboards
4. **Collaboration** - Help requests routing
