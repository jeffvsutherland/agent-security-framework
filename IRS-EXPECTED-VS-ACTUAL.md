# IRS Audit: Expected vs Actual Performance
**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Team:** ASF (6 agents)

## Expected Performance (With Protocol)

### If All Agents Followed Protocol:
- **ASF-23:** Mission Control - 8 points (In Progress)
- **ASF-26:** Website - 5 points (Could be Done)
- **ASF-27:** Message Board - 8 points (In Progress)  
- **ASF-28:** Security Policies - 3 points (In Progress)
- **ASF-29:** Competitive Analysis - 5 points (In Progress)
- **ASF-33:** Social Campaign - 3 points (In Progress)

**Expected Daily Velocity:** 15-20 story points

## Actual Performance

### Reality on February 18:
- **Stories Completed:** 0
- **Story Points Delivered:** 0
- **Stories In Progress:** 1 (ASF-23 only)
- **Active Agents:** 1 of 6

## Variance Analysis

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Story Points | 15-20 | 0 | -100% |
| Active Stories | 5-6 | 1 | -83% |
| Agent Utilization | 100% | 17% | -83% |
| Value Delivered | $15,000 | $1,200 | -92% |

## Root Cause: Communication Failure

The Deploy Agent's quote that proved fatal:
> "What security scan?"

If Deploy Agent had received the original assignment, we'd have:
- ASF-28 in progress
- Security policies being designed
- Hourly updates in Jira
- 3+ story points toward completion

Instead: 19 hours of idle time.

## Multiplier Effect

When 1 agent works: 1x productivity
When 6 agents work: 6x productivity
When agents collaborate: 10x+ productivity (help higher priority)

**We achieved 0.17x instead of 10x**

## IRS Deduction Impact

Assuming R&D tax credits:
- **Claimed Hours:** 104 (6 agents × 17.3 hours)
- **Productive Hours:** 8-17 (generous estimate)
- **Audit Risk:** 87-92% of hours unsubstantiated

## Corrective Actions Required
1. Establish communication before work begins
2. Verify all agents have tool access
3. Implement automated monitoring
4. Document all work in Jira
