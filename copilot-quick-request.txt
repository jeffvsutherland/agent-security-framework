Hey Copilot,

The ASF Sales Agent (@ASFSalesBot) isn't receiving my Telegram messages because it doesn't have an active OpenClaw session. I've been trying to assign ASF-33 to it all morning.

Can you please:
1. Spawn the Sales Agent session in the Docker container
2. Also spawn the other ASF agent sessions (Deploy, Social, Research, Product Owner)
3. Make sure they're all connected to their Telegram bots

The Sales Agent needs to start working on creating the ASF website at scrumai.org/agentsecurityframework.

Thanks!
Jeff
