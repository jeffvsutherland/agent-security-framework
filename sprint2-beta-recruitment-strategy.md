- Early access to enterprise-grade verification before it goes public

**What beta testing involves:**
- 2-week commitment (Sprint 2 timeline)
- Test API integration + web dashboard

### **Template 3: Enterprise Prospect Outreach**
```markdown
Subject: Solve Your Fake Agent Problem - Beta Access

Hi [Name],

I noticed [company] is building with AI agents. Quick question: how are you handling fake agent verification?

We just solved this problem for Discord communities (99% accuracy catching fakes) and we're launching the enterprise version next month.

**The Problem You Might Have:**

- No reliable way to verify authenticity  
- Manual moderation doesn't scale
- Customer trust declining

**Our Solution:**
- Real-time agent verification API
- Enterprise dashboard for monitoring
- Custom integration for your tech stack
- 99% accuracy (proven in production)

**Beta Opportunity:**
Free enterprise access during 2-week testing period. Help us build exactly what you need.

Would a 15-minute demo call make sense? I can show you live verification results from our Discord implementation.
