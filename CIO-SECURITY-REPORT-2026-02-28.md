## Executive Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Overall Security Score:** 8/10

This report provides a human-readable overview of the OpenClaw security posture, showing which security layers are operational and which require attention.

---

## Security Layers Detail

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that only authorized agents and users can access the system.

**Technical Details:** IAM configured with role-based access control

**Business Impact:** Without IAM, anyone could access your agent infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 2. Network Segmentation
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that agent containers cannot directly access your corporate network or the internet without going through controlled pathways.

**Technical Details:** Network segmentation configured - containers isolated from host

**Business Impact:** Without segmentation, a compromised agent could access your entire network.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 3. Container Isolation
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Score:** 0.5/1

**What this means:** We verify that agent containers cannot break out of their sandbox to access the host system.

**Technical Details:** Some container capabilities may not be fully restricted

**Business Impact:** Without proper isolation, a malicious skill could access your entire server.

**Recommendation:** Review Docker security options and ensure cap_drop is enabled.

---

### 4. Secrets Management
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that API keys, passwords, and tokens are encrypted, not stored in plain text.

**Technical Details:** HashiCorp Vault configured for secrets management

**Business Impact:** Exposed secrets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 5. Instruction Security (SOUL.md)
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that each agent has a defined "conscience" (SOUL.md) that constrains its behavior.

**Technical Details:** Agent personality defined with security constraints in SOUL.md

**Business Impact:** Without SOUL.md, agents could take unintended actions that harm your business.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 6. Skill Verification
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that all agent skills (plugins) are scanned for malicious code before installation.

**Technical Details:** Skills verified before installation via YARA rules

**Business Impact:** Unverified skills can contain malware that steals data or compromises your system.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 7. Runtime Protection
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that we can detect attacks happening in real-time, not just prevent them.

**Technical Details:** ASF-42 Syscall monitoring active - traces mount, execve, ptrace

**Business Impact:** Without runtime protection, you won't know if you're being attacked.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 8. Monitoring & Alerting
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that security events generate alerts to your team immediately.

**Technical Details:** Discord/Telegram alerts configured for security events

**Business Impact:** Without alerting, breaches can happen without anyone knowing.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

### 9. Backup & Recovery
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Score:** 0.5/1

**What this means:** We verify that your data is backed up and can be recovered in case of disaster.

**Technical Details:** Basic backups configured but not tested

**Business Impact:** Without verified backups, a ransomware attack or hardware failure could destroy all data.

**Recommendation:** Test backup restoration procedure.

---

### 10. Documentation & Compliance
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Score:** 1/1

**What this means:** We verify that security policies and procedures are documented.

**Technical Details:** Security documentation complete in ASF-18

**Business Impact:** Without documentation, you cannot demonstrate compliance to auditors.

**Recommendation:** None - this layer is fully operational.

---

## Executive Summary - Score

**Overall Security Score: 8/10**

### Rating: STRONG

Your OpenClaw deployment has 8 out of 10 security layers fully operational.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review Container Isolation (Layer 3):** Add cap_drop: ALL to your Docker compose files
2. **Test Backup & Recovery (Layer 9):** Verify you can restore from backups
3. **Continue Monitoring:** Run this scan weekly to track progress
