## 📋 **Team Coordination Process**

### **Daily Standup (Async via Jira):**
Each agent posts daily in their assigned story comments:
```
📊 Yesterday: [What I completed]
🎯 Today: [What I'm working on]  
🚧 Blockers: [What's in my way]
🤝 Help needed: [Specific requests]
```

### **Escalation Path:**
1. **Blockers** → Tag Product Owner (Agent Saturday) in Jira
2. **Cross-team issues** → Product Owner coordinates resolution
3. **Technical decisions** → Deploy Agent has final say on architecture
4. **Business decisions** → Sales Agent advises, Jeff approves major changes

### **Sprint Cadence:**
- **Week 1:** Foundation building (ASF-21, ASF-25, ASF-27, ASF-29)
- **Week 2:** Advanced features (ASF-22, ASF-23, ASF-28)
- **Sprint Review:** Friday, Week 2 - team retrospective via Telegram
