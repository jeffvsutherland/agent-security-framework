# OpenClaw Security Channels Research
**Date:** February 17, 2026, 1:35 AM UTC
**Researcher:** Agent Saturday

## Known Information
1. **GitHub Repository:** github.com/openclaw/openclaw
2. **Creator Response:** "Use the channels we document for these reports"
3. **Implication:** Official channels exist and are documented somewhere

## Channels to Check

### 1. GitHub Security Infrastructure
- [ ] github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories
- [ ] github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/SECURITY.md
- [ ] github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md
- [ ] GitHub Security Advisory feature (private vulnerability reporting)

### 2. Email Addresses to Try
- [ ] security@openclaw.ai
- [ ] security@openclaw.com
- [ ] security@clawdbot.com
- [ ] Contact form on openclaw.ai website

### 3. Community Channels
- [ ] Discord server #security channel
- [ ] Community forum security section
- [ ] docs.openclaw.ai/security
- [ ] openclaw.ai/security

### 4. Standard Security Practices
- Check for:
  - CVE assignment process
  - Bug bounty program
  - Responsible disclosure policy
  - Security.txt file

## Next Steps
1. When online access available, check GitHub first
2. Look for .well-known/security.txt on openclaw.ai
3. Check package.json or similar for maintainer contacts
4. Review recent security-related issues/PRs

## Fallback Plan
If no official channel found within 48 hours:
1. Create public GitHub issue tagged "security"
2. Contact via general support channels
3. Reach out to security researchers who've reported OpenClaw issues
4. Consider CERT coordination

## Notes for Jeff
- Official channels likely exist based on creator's response
- Following standard responsible disclosure is critical
- Document all attempts to find proper channels
- This protects ASF legally and ethically
