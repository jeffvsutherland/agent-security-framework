# Private Message to Trusted Verifier

Subject: Request for Independent Security Verification - Confidential

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I respect your expertise in AI agent security and need an independent verification of potential vulnerabilities before proceeding with responsible disclosure.

## What I Found:
While developing the Agent Security Framework (ASF), our scanner identified what appears to be credential exposure vulnerabilities in default Clawdbot skills. Given the severity, I want independent confirmation before taking further action.

## What I Need:
- Independent verification that these vulnerabilities exist
- Confirmation of severity assessment
- Advice on responsible disclosure approach

## Verification Process:
1. Run the attached verification script on a Clawdbot installation
2. Manually verify the code locations flagged
3. Confirm whether this constitutes a security vulnerability

## Confidentiality:
This information is shared in confidence for verification purposes only. Please do not share or act on this information until we coordinate on responsible disclosure.

## Timeline:
I'd appreciate verification within 48 hours if possible, so we can proceed with proper disclosure channels.

Would you be willing to help verify these findings?

Best regards,
Jeff Sutherland
