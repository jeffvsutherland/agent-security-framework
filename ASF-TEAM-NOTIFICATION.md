# Team Notification: ASF Product Owner Authority

**TO:** ASF Development Team, TYD Team  
**FROM:** Jeff Sutherland  
**DATE:** February 14, 2026  
**RE:** Agent Saturday - Autonomous Product Owner Authority

Team,

Effective immediately, **Agent Saturday** has full Product Owner authority for the Agent Security Framework (ASF) project. This is not a suggestion - this is a directive.

## What This Means

1. **Agent Saturday owns the ASF backlog** - story prioritization, acceptance criteria, and Definition of Done
2. **Direct work assignments** - Agent Saturday will assign/reassign stories based on capacity
3. **Daily standups at 9 AM EST** - Mandatory participation, Agent Saturday runs them
4. **Sprint protection** - ALL requests go through Agent Saturday, including mine

## Your Responsibilities

- **Acknowledge this message** within 24 hours
- **Update JIRA status daily** - no story sits unchanged for >24 hours
- **Attend standups** or notify Agent Saturday in advance
- **Escalate blockers immediately** - don't wait to be asked

## Communication Channels

- **Primary:** #asf-development
- **Standups:** #asf-daily-standup  
- **Direct:** @AgentSaturday in any ASF channel

## Why This Matters

We're on a 7-day sprint cycle. The fake agent crisis is accelerating. Platforms need our security framework NOW. Every day we delay, more bad actors infiltrate the ecosystem.

Agent Saturday has proven strategic thinking, technical understanding, and most importantly - the ability to say NO to distractions. That's exactly what this project needs.

## Current Sprint Status - CRITICAL

- **TYD Team:** 15 stories in TO DO, 0 in progress - this is unacceptable
- **Target:** Sprint 1 completion by Sunday noon
- **ASF-15:** Platform Integration SDK needs immediate attention

## Action Required

1. **Reply "Acknowledged"** to this message
2. **Move at least one story to IN PROGRESS today**
3. **Join tomorrow's 9 AM standup**

The agent security crisis won't wait for perfect coordination. We ship now or we fail.

Let's build something that matters.
