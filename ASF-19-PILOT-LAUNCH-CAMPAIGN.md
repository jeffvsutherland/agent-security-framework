## 💡 Competitive Intelligence

### When Prospects Mention Competitors

**"We're looking at LLMGuard"**
- Response: "LLMGuard uses AI to detect AI - that's like asking a criminal to catch criminals. ASF uses deterministic analysis that can't be fooled."

**"We have CrowdStrike"**
- Response: "CrowdStrike is great for traditional threats. But they can't see inside AI agent behavior. ASF integrates with CrowdStrike to fill this gap."

**"We built our own solution"**
- Response: "Impressive! Many of our customers started there too. They switched to ASF for the continuous updates and community intelligence we provide."

**"We trust our agent vendors"**
- Response: "Even legitimate vendors can be compromised. The Rufio attack came from a trusted repository. Trust but verify with ASF."

## 🚨 Escalation Triggers

- No discovery calls scheduled → Double outreach volume
- No responses at all → Revise messaging approach
- No pilot interest → Offer free security assessment

**If by Friday (Feb 20):**
- Less than 2 pilots committed → CEO escalation
- No technical demos done → Simplify demo process
- Pipeline empty → Emergency prospecting sprint

## 💬 Talk Track for Common Objections

**"We don't have budget"**
"The pilot is completely free for 30 days, and the ROI from preventing just one breach pays for ASF for 10 years. Plus, security budgets often have emergency funds for critical vulnerabilities - which this is."

**"We need IT/Legal approval"**
"Totally understand. Our pilot agreement is specifically designed to bypass lengthy approvals - it's risk-free, requires no infrastructure changes, and can be terminated anytime. Many CISOs have authority to approve free pilots directly."

**"Too busy right now"**
"I appreciate you're busy. That's exactly why fake agents are so dangerous - they exploit when security teams are stretched thin. Our deployment takes just 2 hours and then runs automatically. Would you prefer to schedule for next week?"

**"Need to evaluate other solutions first"**
"Smart approach. While you're evaluating, fake agents are active in your environment right now. Why not run our free pilot in parallel? You'll have real detection data to compare against theoretical capabilities of others."

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Sprint 2 Goal: 2-3 Pilots Launched
