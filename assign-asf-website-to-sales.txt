@ASFSalesBot Please work on ASF-33: Create Agent Security Framework Website

Create a professional website for ASF at scrumai.org/agentsecurityframework

Key requirements:
- Design similar to Moltbook or OpenClaw (modern, clean)
- Homepage with clear value proposition
- Features section (self-healing, auto-fix, etc.)
- Getting Started guide
- Download/installation instructions
- Link to GitHub repo
- Mobile responsive
- Work with existing scrumai.org web team

The site already has traffic, so this will help convert visitors into ASF users.

Update Jira hourly with your progress. Start with wireframes/mockups.
