--- How to fix ---
The OpenClaw Chrome extension needs port 18792 (browser CDP relay).
The gateway container only exposes port 18789.

Option 1: Stop and recreate the gateway with port 18792 exposed:
  docker stop openclaw-gateway
  docker rm openclaw-gateway
  # Re-run with -p 18792:18792 added

Option 2: Use the OpenClaw CLI to enable the browser relay:
  openclaw browser start chrome

Option 3: Point the Chrome extension to the gateway port instead:
  In extension settings, change relay URL to http://127.0.0.1:18789

--- openclaw CLI ---
  which openclaw: /opt/homebrew/bin/openclaw
