# ASF Customer Pilot Program Overview

**Program Launch:** February 2026  
**Target:** 2-3 Enterprise Pilot Customers  
**Duration:** 30-Day Free Trial → Annual Contract

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Agent Security Framework (ASF) solves the **99% fake agent crisis** that's threatening AI adoption across enterprises. Our Layer 0 security technology provides **deterministic, LLM-immune** agent verification that catches credential stealers, data exfiltrators, and malicious agents before they compromise your infrastructure.
