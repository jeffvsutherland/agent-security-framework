## 💡 Insights from Overnight Work

### Oracle Fix Confirmation
Successfully recreated the one-line Oracle security fix:
```bash
unset OPENAI_API_KEY ANTHROPIC_API_KEY GEMINI_API_KEY && exec npx -y @steipete/oracle "$@"
```
Located at: `/app/skills/oracle/oracle`

### Team Agent Limitation
Discovered I can't directly communicate with other team agents (session tree restriction). Need different approach for multi-agent coordination in future sprints.

### Documentation Value
Creating comprehensive documentation enables async work. Even without direct agent communication, clear docs allow seamless handoffs.

## 🚀 Ready for Jeff's Return

Everything is prepared for a productive Sunday:
- Security disclosure can proceed once channels found
- Discord bots ready to deploy
- Blog post polished and impactful
- Customer outreach templates complete
- Moltbook strategy timed perfectly

The Sunday Sprint 2 push should go smoothly with all this preparation done.
