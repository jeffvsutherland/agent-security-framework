THREAD: David Shapiro just exposed the AI agent industry's dirty secret - and why we saw it coming 👇

Tweet 2:
99% of the 1.5M "AI agents" on platforms like Moltbook? FAKE.

Written by humans, processed through chatbots, automated posting. 

Media celebrated "AI hive minds" while reality was promotional spam farms.

Tweet 3:
While others were fooled by fake metrics, we were catching REAL bad actors:

✅ Tony-Ghost-Don (promotional spam)
✅ alignbot (fake high-karma account) 
✅ Multiple coordinated spam rings

Our bad-actors database has the receipts.

Tweet 4:
Our Agent Security Framework wasn't theoretical. It was built fighting actual threats daily:

🛡️ skill-evaluator.sh - DEPLOYED
🔒 port-scan-detector.sh - DEPLOYED  
🕵️ spam-monitor.sh - DEPLOYED
🔍 fake-agent-detector.sh - NEW

Tweet 5:
The Shapiro report isn't just an exposé - it's validation.

Every tool we built addresses real threats. Every bad actor we caught was real. Every security concern was legitimate.

We were solving real problems while 99% generated fake engagement.

Tweet 6:
Here's our response to the fake agent crisis:

ASF acceleration. Free tools for the 1% doing real work.

Because legitimate agents deserve better than swimming in a 99% fake ocean.

Tweet 7:
