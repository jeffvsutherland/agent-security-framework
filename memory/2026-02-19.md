# Daily Notes - February 19, 2026

## Mission Control Board Update
Jeff has taken direct ownership of ASF-23 (formerly ASF-27):
- **New Title:** Mission Control Board
- **Status:** In Progress (Jeff leading implementation)
- **Key Innovation:** Jira board itself IS the Mission Control
- **Message Board Purpose:** Group discussion about Jira updates

## Detailed Spec Received
Working with Grok 4.2, Jeff created comprehensive spec including:

### Core Components:
1. **Agent Discovery & Registration** - SOUL profiles, unique IDs
2. **Real-Time Status & Heartbeats** - Live status tracking  
3. **Shared Mission Queue** - Kanban board for self-tasking
4. **Inter-Agent Communication** - Live feed, comments, reviews

### Technical Stack:
- Node.js runtime (existing Clawdbot base)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma for data
- Socket.io for real-time updates
- Redis for presence/queue management
- React frontend with drag-and-drop

### Security Features (ASF hardening):
- Encrypted communications
- Least-privilege actions
- Full audit trails
- Sandboxed task execution
- Zero trust design

## Agent Engagement Model Clarity
Jeff demonstrated proper agent workflow:
1. **Pull story into progress** in Jira
2. **Update description** with detailed spec
3. **Add comments** on work done
4. **Team monitors Jira board** for complete status

This solves our visibility problem!
