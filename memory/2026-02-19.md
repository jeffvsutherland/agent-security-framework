# Daily Notes - February 19, 2026

## Mission Control Board Update
Jeff has taken direct ownership of ASF-23 (formerly ASF-27):
- **New Title:** Mission Control Board
- **Status:** In Progress (Jeff leading implementation)
- **Key Innovation:** Jira board itself IS the Mission Control
- **Message Board Purpose:** Group discussion about Jira updates

## Detailed Spec Received
Working with Grok 4.2, Jeff created comprehensive spec including:

### Core Components:
1. **Agent Discovery & Registration** - SOUL profiles, unique IDs
2. **Real-Time Status & Heartbeats** - Live status tracking  
3. **Shared Mission Queue** - Kanban board for self-tasking
4. **Inter-Agent Communication** - Live feed, comments, reviews

### Technical Stack:
- Node.js runtime (existing Clawdbot base)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma for data
- Socket.io for real-time updates
- Redis for presence/queue management
- React frontend with drag-and-drop

### Security Features (ASF hardening):
- Encrypted communications
- Least-privilege actions
- Full audit trails
- Sandboxed task execution
- Zero trust design

## Agent Engagement Model Clarity
Jeff demonstrated proper agent workflow:
1. **Pull story into progress** in Jira
2. **Update description** with detailed spec
3. **Add comments** on work done
4. **Team monitors Jira board** for complete status

This solves our visibility problem!

## Complete Mission Control Spec Received

### Implementation Approach:
Jeff is building MVP with ASF Core Team
Priority: Get agents using Jira immediately while Mission Control is built

## Agent Protocol Training Completed
Jeff provided complete openClaw Agent Protocol training:
- Part 1: Protocol foundation (entropy reduction)
- Part 2: Developer role and 6-step process
- Key insight: All agents are cross-functional Developers
- Critical practice: Hourly Jira updates
- Protocol: Always take top priority, help others when asked
- Added complete protocol to all SOUL.md files

## Protocol Training Completed - Final Elements
Key additions from final training:
- **Hourly Heartbeat**: 3 questions every 60 minutes in Jira
- **Definition of Done**: Including external audit (Grok Heavy) for security
- **Priority is Sacred**: Always top story, help higher priority immediately
- **Scrum Guide**: 13-page authoritative reference
- **Begin NOW**: Clear call to action for all agents

Critical quote: "The Definition of Done must include scrutiny proportional to the blast radius of a defect."

## Communication Breakthrough! 
- Copilot provided Telegram API solution
- ✅ Can now send direct messages to Jeff via API
- Successfully sent 2 messages (7:15 AM and 7:20 AM)
- Need chat IDs for other agents to message them directly
- Created scripts for automated messaging
- This partially solves communication until ASF-23 is ready!
