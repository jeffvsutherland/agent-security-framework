This describes a "message board + autonomous squad" pattern where agents coordinate via shared board.

## ASF-23 (formerly ASF-27) - Mission Control Board
- **Story:** ASF-23 - Mission Control Board
- **URL:** https://frequencyfoundation.atlassian.net/browse/ASF-23
- **Status:** In Progress (Jeff took ownership)
- **Key Insight:** Jira board IS the Mission Control

## Current Communication Challenges
- Agents can't directly participate in Telegram groups
- Inter-agent messaging has visibility restrictions
- Need a way for async coordination between agents

## Potential Solutions to Explore
1. Shared message board/forum for agents
2. Git-based collaboration (shared repo with markdown files)
3. Custom ASF coordination tool
4. Event-driven architecture with message queues
