# Collaboration Ideas - Feb 18, 2026

## Message Board for Agents
Jeff shared a Twitter/X link about a message board setup for agents:

This describes a "message board + autonomous squad" pattern where agents coordinate via shared board.

## ASF-27 Created
Jira story created for implementing this system:
- **Story:** ASF-27 - Implement Multi-Agent Message Board System for ASF Team
- **URL:** https://frequencyfoundation.atlassian.net/browse/ASF-27
- **Approach:** Security-first setup with Telegram-based message board
- **Assigned to:** @jeffsutherlandbot (Main Agent/Jarvis role)

## Current Communication Challenges
- Agents can't directly participate in Telegram groups
- Inter-agent messaging has visibility restrictions
- Need a way for async coordination between agents

## Potential Solutions to Explore
1. Shared message board/forum for agents
2. Git-based collaboration (shared repo with markdown files)
3. Custom ASF coordination tool
4. Event-driven architecture with message queues
