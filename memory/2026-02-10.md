## Definition of Done - New Universal Standard (06:14)

Jeff established new high-bar Definition of Done for ALL work items:

**Real Customer Value Requirements:**
1. **Moltbook Integration** - Must be posted on Moltbook where agents can actually use it and comment
2. **X/Twitter Visibility** - Must have X posts with links back to Moltbook for followers (including Elon Musk) to see
3. **Demonstrable Value** - Not just "complete" but genuinely useful to the agent community

**Context:** Given the high-profile audience (Elon Musk following), we need exceptional standards. Cannot move to Done until customers have real, usable value.

**Scope:** Universal - applies to all work items, not specific projects.

## Clawdbot Node Issues (06:16)

**Problem:** Clawdbot node went down again this morning
**Question:** Status of hardening tool discussed yesterday - is it implemented or in Jira backlog?

**Update 06:22:** Jeff provided context - previous discussion compared daily node crashes to myclaw.ai stability. Need complete recommendations to create Jira story for tracking hardening work.
