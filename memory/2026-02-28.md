### Key Learnings

2. **Grok Heavy Review Process** - Very thorough:
   - Requires specific integration tables at top of .md files
   - Needs scripts in specific locations
   - Zero tolerance for secrets
   - Multiple review rounds needed

3. **Proper Push Sequence**:
   - Source GitHub token: `source ~/clawd/.env`
   - Set remote: `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/...`
   - Check before pushing: `git log` and `git diff`
