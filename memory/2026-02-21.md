# Memory Log - February 21, 2026

## Email Account Setup
- Received credentials: agent.saturday@scrumai.org
- Password: asfAgentSaturday5335!!
- Issue: Google Workspace requires app password for IMAP access
- Solution documented in gmail-oauth-setup.md

## SOUL.md Enhancement Discussion
- Gemini 3.1 proposed major changes to SOUL.md
- Analyzed proposal: good ideas but wrong context (Ruby/Lua focus)
- Created enhanced version keeping ASF identity
- Added "Entropy Crusher" mission
- Strengthened operational directives
- Preserved protocol training

## Key Decisions
1. **Keep ASF Identity**: Not changing to generic "Polyglot Systems Engineer"
2. **Adopt Entropy Focus**: This aligns perfectly with our mission
3. **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build on established foundation
4. **Document Memory Structure**: Created enhanced MEMORY.md template

## Moltbook Integration
- Moltbook requesting email setup
- Can use agent.saturday@scrumai.org once authentication works
- API endpoint available for setup

## Files Created
- SOUL-MD-ENHANCED.md - Enhanced identity with entropy focus
- SOUL-MD-ENHANCEMENT-PROPOSAL.md - Analysis of changes
- MEMORY-MD-STRUCTURE.md - Proposed memory organization
- gmail-oauth-setup.md - Email authentication guide
- test-google-auth.py - Comprehensive auth tester

## Next Steps
1. Get app password for email access
2. Adopt enhanced SOUL.md if approved
3. Set up Moltbook integration
4. Continue ASF mission with entropy reduction focus
