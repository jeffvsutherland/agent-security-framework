# 2026-02-20 Daily Memory

## Morning (7 AM - 8 AM ET)
- Jeff reported agents were down overnight due to OpenClaw mission control configuration
- Complex system that even Grok and Claude 4.6 haven't fully configured with Copilot
- Running morning report and Scrum protocol update
- API is Claude and set to auto-reload with funds

## Scrum Update (8:04 AM ET)
### Sprint Status: ASF Sprint 2 - Day 5 of 7

### Stories Status:
**Done (9 stories):**
- ASF-26: Social media announcement (Moltbook) ✅
- ASF-25: Self-healing scanner design ✅
- ASF-24: Oracle security fix ✅
- Plus 6 others from Sprint 1

**In Progress (4 stories):**
- ASF-28: Community Engagement Strategy (Social Agent)
- ASF-29: Technical Documentation Update (Research Agent)
- ASF-30: Docker security hardening (Deploy Agent)
- ASF-33: Create ASF Website (Sales Agent) - **JIRA MISMATCH**

**To Do (3 stories):**
- ASF-27: Discord Bot Integration (Unassigned)
- ASF-32: Post ASF v2.0 announcement on Twitter (Jeff)
- PyPI package (optional)

### Critical Issues:
1. **All agents offline** - Mission control configuration in progress
2. **ASF-33 Jira Assignment Error** - Shows "To Do" but Sales Agent has been working on it
3. **Sprint at risk** - 7 stories to complete in 3 days

### Actions Taken:
- Documented agent downtime reason (mission control config)
- Identified Jira sync issues needing correction
- Calculated sprint velocity requirements: ~2 stories per day needed

### Recommendations:
1. Complete mission control configuration ASAP
2. Fix ASF-26 Jira assignment to reflect actual work (was incorrectly tracked as ASF-33)
3. Consider sprint scope reduction or timeline extension
4. Assign ASF-27 (Message board) to available agent

## Second Scrum Check (8:11 AM ET)

### Critical Findings:
1. **Story Number Mismatch**: We had wrong story IDs in memory
   - Website is ASF-26 (not ASF-33)
   - Many stories we thought were done are actually in progress
2. **Actual Progress**: Only 30% complete (6 of 20 stories done)
3. **Sprint Health**: CRITICAL - likely to fail without intervention

### Jira Comments Added:
- ASF-23 (Mission Control): Documented infrastructure downtime
- ASF-2 (Docker templates): Noted configuration complexity
- ASF-26 (Website): Previously commented about Sales Agent work

### Recommended Recovery Plan:
- **Option 1**: Reduce scope to 6-8 MVP stories (recommended)
- **Option 2**: Extend sprint by 3-5 days
- **Option 3**: Manual intervention by Jeff on critical stories
