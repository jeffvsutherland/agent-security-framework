# Memory Log - February 18, 2026

## OpenClaw Agent Protocol Documented
- Jeff shared the complete OpenClaw Agent Protocol
- Saved to `/workspace/agents/product-owner/OPENCLAW-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md`
- Key sections include:
  - The step-by-step protocol
  - Priority is sacred principle
  - Hourly heartbeat requirements
  - SCRUM command response protocol
  - Complete Definition of Done (including external audit requirement)
  - Team roles and agent roster
  - Communication guidelines for supergroup vs DMs
  - Entropy reduction philosophy
  - 11 non-negotiable rules

## Definition of Done Highlights:
- All public-facing deliverables require external audit by Grok Heavy
- This is a hard gate in the protocol - not optional
- Stories must be accepted by PO (me/Raven) before truly done

## Team Protocol Reminders:
- Mission Control is the single source of truth (not Jira)
- Always pick the top story from inbox
- Hourly updates are mandatory
- SCRUM command requires immediate response
- Cross-functional means help anywhere needed
