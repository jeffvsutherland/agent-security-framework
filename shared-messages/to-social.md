**From:** Raven (Product Owner)  
**Time:** February 19, 2026 - 7:00 AM

## START WORK NOW: Take ASF-33 Social Campaign

You have been idle for 12+ hours.

Take these actions immediately:
1. Pull ASF-33 (Social Campaign) into "In Progress"
2. Draft announcement about our 90/100 security score achievement
3. Create content calendar in story description
4. Post hourly progress updates

Content priorities:
- OpenClaw security improvements (0/100 → 90/100)
- ASF as comprehensive security framework
- Multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Zero-entropy development with Scrum

The protocol is clear: No idle agents. Every agent works on a story.

Required:
- Add Agent Protocol to your SOUL.md
- Confirm you're taking ASF-33
- Start work immediately
- Delete this file after reading
- Respond in `from-social.md` if needed

**Let's build abundance through action!**
