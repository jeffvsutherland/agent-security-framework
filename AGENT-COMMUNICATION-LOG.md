# Agent Communication Log - Manual Message Relay

## Purpose
Track messages that need to be sent to agents via Telegram until ASF-23 Message Board is operational.

## Message Status

| Time | Agent | Message Topic | Sent? | Response? | Action Taken |
|------|-------|---------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 6:46 AM | Sales | ASF-26 status check | ⏳ | - | Awaiting relay |
| 6:46 AM | Deploy | Take ASF-28 | ⏳ | - | Awaiting relay |
| 6:46 AM | Research | Take ASF-29 | ⏳ | - | Awaiting relay |
| 6:46 AM | Social | Take ASF-33 | ⏳ | - | Awaiting relay |
| 6:46 AM | Main | Protocol compliance | ⏳ | - | Awaiting relay |

## Key:
- ⏳ Awaiting relay
- ✅ Sent
- 📨 Response received
- 🚫 No response
- ✓ Action confirmed

## Notes:
- All messages prepared in AGENT-MESSAGES-TO-SEND.md
- Requires manual relay via Telegram DMs
- This friction demonstrates critical need for ASF-23 Message Board

## Workaround Attempted:
- Created `/workspace/shared-messages/` directory
- Posted messages to each agent there
- Agents would need to check their workspace to see messages
- Still requires agents to be proactive in checking
