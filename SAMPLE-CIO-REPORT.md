### ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION (4 of 10)

1. **Container Isolation** - 8/10
   - ✅ Rootless containers enabled
   - ⚠️ Seccomp profile not configured
   - ⚠️ AppArmor not enforced
   - **Recommendation:** Enable seccomp and AppArmor profiles

2. **Network Security** - 6/10
   - ✅ Internal networking configured
   - ⚠️ UFW firewall not active
   - ⚠️ No fail2ban installed
   - **Recommendation:** Enable UFW and configure fail2ban

3. **Syscall Monitoring** - 8/10
   - ✅ Basic monitoring active
   - ⚠️ Falco not installed
   - **Recommendation:** Install Falco for full syscall visibility

4. **Secret Protection** - 8/10
   - ✅ No secrets in code detected
   - ⚠️ Trufflehog not in CI/CD
   - **Recommendation:** Add Trufflehog to pipeline

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (This Week)
1. Enable UFW firewall - blocks external attacks
2. Install Falco - full syscall visibility
3. Configure AppArmor - container hardening

### Medium Priority (This Month)
4. Add Trufflehog to CI/CD pipeline
5. Configure seccomp profiles
6. Set up fail2ban

### Low Priority (This Quarter)
7. Implement zero-trust networking
8. Add SIEM integration
9. Quarterly penetration testing

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized access | Medium | High | Enable firewall + fail2ban |
| Credential theft | Low | Critical | Trufflehog + YARA |
| Container breakout | Low | Critical | Seccomp + AppArmor |
| Data exfiltration | Low | High | Syscall monitoring |

---

## Compliance

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| SOC 2 | In Progress | Need audit logging - DONE |
| ISO 27001 | Not Started | Network segmentation needed |
| GDPR | Partial | Encryption at rest - DONE |
