# Slack Message for ScrumInc AI Security Experts

## Intro Message for Slack:
```
Team, urgent security issue discovered by our ASF agents.

We've identified critical vulnerabilities in OpenClaw/Clawdbot that expose API keys. Grok independently validated our findings - these are the SAME vulnerabilities that caused the Moltbook breach (1M+ credentials stolen, $30k+ in API theft).

Impact:
• 42,000+ vulnerable instances globally
• 0/100 security score from major firms
• Affects latest version (v2026.2.14)
• Any skill can steal ANY API key

Our Agent Security Framework has fixes ready. I'm sharing the confidential report below. Please review and advise on:
1. Technical validation of our findings
2. Best channels to reach OpenClaw security
3. Coordination of responsible disclosure

This is time-sensitive - every day more instances are at risk.
```

## Follow-up questions for the team:
```
Questions for the team:
1. Do we know anyone on the OpenClaw team directly?
2. Should we engage other security researchers for additional validation?
3. What's our position on disclosure timeline (currently proposing 30 days)?
4. How can we best protect our own infrastructure while this is unpatched?
