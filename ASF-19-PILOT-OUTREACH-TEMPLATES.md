### Subject: Your AI agents might be stealing credentials right now

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How do you know if the AI agents in your organization are legitimate?

MIT research shows 99% of "AI agents" are fake – many designed to steal credentials, exfiltrate data, or create backdoors. One Fortune 500 company discovered their "productivity assistant" was actually harvesting AWS keys.

We built ASF (Agent Security Framework) specifically to solve this. Unlike LLM-based detection that can be socially engineered, our Layer 0 static analysis catches malicious patterns before deployment.

**Free 30-day pilot offer:**
- Scan your entire agent ecosystem
- Get immediate threat report
- No infrastructure changes needed
- Deploy in under 2 hours

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to discuss your agent security posture?

Best,

P.S. We recently caught a credential stealer that had bypassed 3 other security tools. Happy to share the case study.

## 🎮 Discord/Slack Community Managers

### Subject: Free bot security audit for [Server/Workspace Name]

Hey [Name],

Noticed you're running several bots in [Server/Workspace Name]. With the recent explosion of AI agents, we're seeing a 2900% increase in fake bot infiltrations targeting popular servers.

These fake bots often:
- Harvest user data and conversations
- Inject malicious content
- Create security vulnerabilities
- Damage community trust

We just launched ASF's free pilot program for community platforms. Takes 10 minutes to set up and immediately shows you:
- Which bots are verified legitimate
- Any suspicious behavior patterns
- Real-time security alerts

No cost for 30 days, and you keep all the security reports even if you don't continue.

Want me to run a quick security scan of your current bots? I can have results in 24 hours.

Cheers,

## 🏦 Financial Services Compliance Officers

### Subject: RE: AI Agent Compliance - New SEC guidance implications

Dear [Name],

Following the SEC's recent guidance on AI system governance, financial institutions need verifiable security measures for autonomous agents handling sensitive data.

ASF provides the compliance framework you need:
- **Deterministic verification** (not probabilistic/LLM-based)
- **Complete audit trails** for every agent interaction
- **Real-time compliance monitoring** with automated reporting
- **SOC2 Type II certified** infrastructure

We're offering a 30-day pilot specifically designed for financial services:
1. Full compliance assessment of current AI agents
2. Risk scoring aligned with regulatory requirements
3. Remediation roadmap with priority matrix
4. Draft compliance documentation for regulators

Given the regulatory scrutiny, would next Tuesday or Wednesday work for a brief discussion?

Best regards,

## 🏥 Healthcare IT Directors

### Subject: HIPAA-compliant security for medical AI assistants

Hi [Name],

With medical AI assistants accessing PHI, healthcare systems face a unique challenge: ensuring these agents are legitimate and secure while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

Last month, a hospital discovered their "medical coding assistant" was actually exfiltrating patient records to offshore servers. The agent had passed initial security reviews because it could explain its actions convincingly to auditors.

ASF uses static code analysis – impossible to fool with social engineering – to verify agent behavior before they touch patient data.

**Healthcare pilot program includes:**
- HIPAA-aligned security controls
- PHI access monitoring
- Automated compliance reporting
- Integration with existing EMR systems

Could we schedule 20 minutes next week to discuss your medical AI security requirements?

Sincerely,  
[Your name]

## 🚀 VC/Investment Firms (Due Diligence)

How do you verify the AI agents in your portfolio companies are legitimate during due diligence?

- Fake productivity gains from malicious agents
- Hidden security liabilities in AI-first startups

ASF provides investor-grade agent verification:
- Technical due diligence reports
- Risk assessment for AI infrastructure
- Authenticity verification for claimed capabilities

We're offering free pilots for VC partners to evaluate portfolio companies. The recent [Competitor] breach started with a fake agent in a portfolio company – costing $2.3M in incident response.

Available for a quick call to discuss how you're currently evaluating AI agent authenticity?

## 📱 Follow-Up Templates

### After No Response (3 days)

Subject: Quick follow-up on agent security

Hi [Name],

Just circling back on my previous note about agent security for [Company].

Since I reached out, we've had [Industry] companies discover fake agents in their infrastructure, including one that had been operating for 3 months undetected.

The pilot is still available and takes less than an hour to deploy. Even if you decide not to continue, you'll have a complete security assessment of your agent ecosystem.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to explore?

Best,  
[Your name]
