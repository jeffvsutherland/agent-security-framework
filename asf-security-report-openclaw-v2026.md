# ASF Security Report for OpenClaw v2026.2.17
**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Scanner Version:** ASF Scanner v2.0 (OpenClaw Edition)

## Executive Summary

The OpenClaw upgrade to v2026.2.17 has **dramatically improved** the security posture of the system:

- **Security Score:** Improved from **0/100** to **90/100** 🎉
- **Dangerous Skills:** Reduced from **40** to **0** 
- **Safe Skills:** Increased from **16** to **50**
- **Warning Skills:** Only **3** remain (gh-issues, notion, trello)

## Key Findings

### 1. Major Security Improvements ✅

The OpenClaw v2026.2.17 upgrade appears to have restructured how skills work:

- **Binary executables removed**: Skills no longer ship with binary executables in their root directories
- **Script-based architecture**: Skills now use Python/shell scripts in the `scripts/` subdirectory
- **Environment variable isolation**: The previously vulnerable binaries that read API keys from environment variables are gone

### 2. Previously Vulnerable Skills - Now Safe 🛡️

The following skills were previously flagged as **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities but are now **SAFE**:

1. **openai-image-gen** 
   - Previously: Read OPENAI_API_KEY from environment (line 176)
   - Now: Uses Python script without direct env var access
   
2. **nano-banana-pro**
   - Previously: Read GEMINI_API_KEY from environment (line 29)  
   - Now: Script-based implementation without env var vulnerabilities

### 3. Current Warning Skills ⚠️

Only 3 skills have warnings, all for making POST requests (legitimate functionality):

1. **gh-issues** - GitHub API integration (POST requests are expected)
2. **notion** - Notion API integration (POST requests are expected)
3. **trello** - Trello API integration (POST requests are expected)

These are **not security vulnerabilities** but legitimate API interactions.

### 4. ASF Fixes No Longer Needed ❌

The wrapper script fixes previously developed for openai-image-gen and nano-banana-pro are **no longer needed** because:
- The vulnerable binary files no longer exist
- The new script-based architecture doesn't have the same vulnerability

## Security Scan Details

```
Total Skills Scanned: 52
✅ Safe Skills: 50
⚠️ Warning Skills: 3  
🚨 Danger Skills: 0
```

### Safe Skills Include:
- All AI/LLM integrations (openai, gemini, anthropic via scripts)
- All messaging integrations (discord, slack, imsg, telegram)
- All productivity tools (notion, obsidian, things-mac, bear-notes)
- All utility skills (weather, canvas, healthcheck, etc.)

## Recommendations

1. **No immediate action required** - The OpenClaw v2026.2.17 upgrade has resolved all critical vulnerabilities

2. **Monitor POST requests** - The 3 warning skills make legitimate POST requests. Ensure they only communicate with their intended APIs

3. **Regular rescans** - Run the ASF scanner periodically to ensure new skills don't introduce vulnerabilities

4. **Best practices going forward**:
   - Review all new skills before installation
   - Check for environment variable access patterns
   - Verify external API endpoints
   - Use the OpenClaw skill sandboxing when available

## Conclusion

The OpenClaw v2026.2.17 upgrade represents a **major security win**. The architectural changes have eliminated the critical environment variable vulnerabilities that previously affected 40 skills. The system is now in a much more secure state with a 90/100 security score.

**No ASF wrapper fixes are needed** - the vulnerabilities have been resolved at the architecture level.
