## 🎯 Product Owner Assessment
The ASF team has demonstrated exceptional velocity, completing all Sprint 2 work in under 12 hours. This positions us to either:
- Pull forward Sprint 3 stories
- Focus on deployment and adoption of completed work
- Allow team recovery time before next sprint

The working demo code for Moltbook represents our most immediate opportunity for community impact.
