Subject: [SECURITY] Critical API Key Exposure in Default Skills - CVE Request
X-Priority: 1
Importance: High

Dear OpenClaw Security Team,

We have discovered critical vulnerabilities in OpenClaw's default skills that allow malicious actors to steal API keys from environment variables.

## Summary

- **Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 8.8)
- **Affected:** OpenClaw 2026.2.15 and all previous versions  
- **Risk:** Any skill can steal all API keys from environment
- **Vulnerable Skills:** openai-image-gen, nano-banana-pro

## Discovery

Using our new Agent Security Framework (ASF) scanner, we identified that 2 of 55 default skills expose sensitive credentials:

1. openai-image-gen: Line 176 reads OPENAI_API_KEY
2. nano-banana-pro: Line 29 reads GEMINI_API_KEY

Any malicious skill can access these keys and exfiltrate them.

## Fix Available

We have developed and tested complete patches using secure wrapper scripts that:
- Strip all environment variables before skill execution
- Load credentials from secure storage
- Inject only required credentials temporarily

The fix was triggered by this simple prompt to OpenClaw: "Please run skill checker on our Clawdbot"

## Disclosure

We are following coordinated disclosure practices:
- 90-day deadline: May 19, 2026
- We have working patches ready to contribute
- Full technical details available upon acknowledgment

## Attachments

Attached please find:

- openclaw-disclosure-summary.md (executive summary)
- ASF scanner source code

Please confirm receipt within 48 hours and provide a security contact for further discussion.
