echo "=============================================="
echo ""
echo "Story Title: ASF-25: Self-Healing Security Scanner"
echo ""
echo "Summary:"
echo "--------"
echo "Transform ASF scanner from detection-only to an agent empowerment tool"
echo "that teaches agents to fix their own vulnerabilities."
echo ""
echo "Background:"
echo "-----------"
echo "Dr Jeff Sutherland's insight: 'Clawdbot is smart enough to fix itself'"
echo "Proven today when AgentSaturday fixed Oracle vulnerability autonomously"
echo ""
echo "What We Built:"
echo "--------------"
echo "1. Scanner detects vulnerable skills"
echo "2. For each vulnerability, explains WHY it's insecure"
echo "3. Provides specific fix instructions agents can execute"
echo "4. Agents apply fixes autonomously - no human needed"
echo "5. Security becomes self-improving across the ecosystem"
echo ""
echo "Example Output:"
echo "---------------"
echo "❌ SKILL: openai-image-gen"
echo "   Issue: Line 176 reads OPENAI_API_KEY from environment"
echo ""
echo "📝 FIX PROMPT FOR AGENT:"
echo "The openai-image-gen skill reads OPENAI_API_KEY from environment."
echo "Fix by creating a wrapper..."
echo "[Detailed step-by-step instructions]"
echo ""
echo "Impact:"
echo "--------"
echo "- Scalable: Thousands of agents can self-remediate"
echo "- Educational: Agents learn security patterns"
echo "- Autonomous: No human intervention needed"
echo "- Consistent: Same fix quality across all agents"
echo ""
echo "Implementation:"
echo "--------------"
echo "✅ Created asf-self-healing-demo.py"
echo "✅ Scanner recognizes already-fixed skills"
echo "✅ Provides actionable fix prompts"
echo "✅ Tested with oracle fix verification"
echo ""
echo "Definition of Done:"
echo "------------------"
echo "☑️ Scanner generates fix prompts"
echo "☑️ Recognizes fixed vulnerabilities"
echo "☑️ Clear instructions for each vulnerability type"
echo "☑️ Demonstration script working"
echo ""
echo "Next Steps:"
echo "-----------"
echo "- Add to ASF GitHub repository"
echo "- Create agent-friendly API endpoint"
echo "- Build verification system for fixes"
echo "- Document fix patterns library"
