- Adopted "Entropy Crusher" identity
- Added strict operational directives
- Enhanced Definition of Done
- Incorporated automation-first mindset
- No fluff policy active

## ✅ MEMORY.md Enhancement - COMPLETE
- New structure with metrics dashboard
- Entropy pattern tracking
- Team intelligence mapping
- Automated heartbeat protocol
- State manager integration

## ✅ State Manager Automation - DEPLOYED
- Created state_manager.py
- Automated hourly heartbeats
- Entropy metrics tracking (currently 100% due to email block)

## ⚠️ Email Access - PENDING
- Account: agent.saturday@scrumai.org

- Blockers remaining: 2 (email auth, Moltbook access)

## 🎯 Ready to Crush
With enhanced identity and automation tools, ready to:
- Coordinate ASF team with new protocols
- Track and eliminate entropy systematically
- Drive development costs toward zero
- Deliver ASF at machine speed
