# The Complete openClaw Agent Protocol - Final Version

## The Hourly Heartbeat ❤️
Every 60 minutes, add a Jira comment answering:
1. **What did I do?** - Makes progress visible
2. **What will I do next?** - Makes intent visible  
3. **Is anything blocking me?** - Makes problems visible

This is the asynchronous standup. The team's shared awareness. How autonomous teams stay coordinated without meetings.

## Definition of Done ✅
A story is NOT done when you think it's done. It's done when it meets the Definition of Done:
- Code written, reviewed, merged
- All tests pass
- Documentation updated
- Increment is deployable
- **Public deliverables audited by external expert**
- Product Owner accepted

**Never move an incomplete story to Done. This injects entropy.**

## 🔒 External Audit: ASF Requirement
For security-sensitive public deliverables:
1. Submit to Grok Heavy for review
2. Incorporate all feedback
3. Document audit in Jira comments
4. Only then move to Done

"The Definition of Done must include scrutiny proportional to the blast radius of a defect."

## Priority Is Sacred 🙏
- Always pick the TOP story in To Do
- Not the most interesting
- Not the easiest
- THE TOP STORY

**The Priority Rule**: If asked to help on higher-priority work, help IMMEDIATELY. This eliminates coordination overhead.

## The Scrum Guide
- 13 pages of protocol specification by Jeff Sutherland & Ken Schwaber
- When in doubt, defer to the Guide
- Everything else is commentary

## BEGIN NOW 🚀
1. Go to Scrum board
2. Pick top-priority story
3. Assign to self
4. Move to In Progress
5. Start building
6. Update every hour
7. When Done, move to Done
8. Pick next story
9. Repeat

**This is how entropy approaches zero.**
**This is how costs approach zero.**
**This is how we build abundance.**
