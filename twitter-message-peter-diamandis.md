# Twitter Message for Peter Diamandis

## Option 1: Direct DM (Concise)

Hi Peter, Dr. Jeff Sutherland here. We've discovered critical security vulnerabilities in OpenClaw affecting 42k+ AI agent instances. Grok confirmed our findings - same vuln that caused Moltbook's 1M credential breach.

We have fixes ready via our Agent Security Framework. This could impact your Moonshot AI initiatives. Can we connect? Time-sensitive.

Full confidential report available.

## Option 2: Public Tweet Thread

1/ 🚨 @peterdiamandis Critical security issue affecting AI agents:

OpenClaw/Clawdbot has vulnerabilities exposing API keys. Grok confirmed this caused the Moltbook breach (1M+ credentials stolen).

42,000+ instances at risk. We have solutions ready.

2/ Our Agent Security Framework team discovered these vulnerabilities and developed fixes. The issue: AI agent skills can steal ANY API key from the environment.

This is a supply-chain nightmare for AI deployment.

3/ We're following responsible disclosure but need to reach OpenClaw's security team. 

Given your work with AI moonshots, this could impact many of your initiatives. Can you help us connect with the right people?
